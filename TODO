1. Entity component system:
	Files - ECS.h ECS.cpp
	Needed classes - Component, Entity, EntityManager
	
	Component class is abstract class that declare next functions: init, draw, update,
	
	Entity class has 5 functions: draw and update that call similliar functions in components, 
	add_component (add new component to entity), get_component (returns needed component) and has_component (return 
	true if component exists).
	
	EntityManager contains all entities.
	EntityManager calls draw and update functions of entities. Manager has add function that creates and 
	returns new entity.
	 
2. Vector2D
	Class storage XY coords as double
	Class can zeroize coords
	Class can add/subtract/multiply/divide other class to itself
	Class can muptiply itself with number
3. Transorm component
	That component describes entity coords and size
